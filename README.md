# Logs

### Overview
Tired of having to deal with Discord text logs that are boring and hard to read? Well, 
[Logs](https://logs.discord.website) aims to solve that problem by giving bot developers an alternative solution to
export their logs. No longer will you have to squint at small text, or have to manually copy attachment links to figure
out what someone said. Instead, you'll be able to view it as if you were still in Discord!

### Installation Instructions
There are currently no installation instructions, as this code is extremely volatile and not guaranteed to run for
everyone. If you are brave enough to successfully install this, feel free to PR! All contributions are encouraged!
