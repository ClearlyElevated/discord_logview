# Discord Logview

### Overview
This is the successor to the legacy branch of this project. The name didn't really fit for what it
was, and the old code was really bad. For now, the old code will be running on my main site 
[here](https://logs.discord.website), until such time when a merger can be safely made. If you want to see this in
action before it goes live, feel free to check out [my staging site](https://logstaging.discord.website). If something breaks,
please message EJH2#0330 on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3X8WwbU)!

### Installation Instructions
There are currently no installation instructions, as this code is extremely volatile and not guaranteed to run for
everyone. If you are brave enough to successfully install this, feel free to PR! All contributions are encouraged!
